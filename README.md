# iOS Developer Playground 📱

Welcome to my personal repository where I explore the exciting realms of iOS development, incorporating the latest technologies and diving into intriguing domains! 🚀

## Technologies in Focus

### UIKit, SwiftUI, Combine 🎨
I like to explore the dynamic and visually stunning world of iOS development with UIKit and SwiftUI and use the power of Combine for reactive and declarative programming.

### async/await ⏳
I'm currently learning the asynchronous paradigm of Swift in order to make code more readable and efficient.

## Passion Projects 💡

### Machine Learning 🤖
Embark on a journey into the realm of intelligent applications. Uncover the magic of machine learning, crafting solutions that learn and adapt.

### Game Theory 🎲
I'm taking a deep dive into the strategic realm of game theory, crafting algorithms and models that simulate and analyze strategic interactions.

### Graph Neural Networks 🌐
I'm fascinated by the world of Graph Neural Networks: uncovering patterns and relationships in complex data structures is so funny.

### Quantum Computing 🚀
I like to experiment with qubits and quantum algorithms for cutting-edge solutions: quantum machine learning and quantum optimization algorithms.

### I’m currently learning 🌱
Go and Rust
